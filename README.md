# Dataset
The Biovid heat pain dataset, containing biosignals (ECG, EMG, and EDA), is the only publicly available resource of its kind. It is divided into two parts; we utilize part A, comprising 87 subjects with 100 data pieces each. These data correspond to different pain levels (T0, T1, T2, T3, T4), with 20 thermal stimulation experiments conducted for each level. Each signal recording lasts 5.5 seconds, with intervals of 8-12 seconds between adjacent stimuli. The original sampling rate is 512 HZ.
